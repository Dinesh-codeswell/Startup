# Questionnaire Submission Fix

## Problem
Users getting error when submitting the team matching questionnaire:
```
Submission failed: Failed to process team matching submission: Failed to submit team matching form: new row violates row-level security policy for table "team_matching_submissions"
```

## Root Cause
The issue is caused by Row Level Security (RLS) policies on the Supabase database that prevent insertions into the `team_matching_submissions` table.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Supabase Admin Client Configuration
**File:** `lib/supabase-admin.ts`
- Updated to properly use the service role key
- Added fallback to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` if `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is not set

### 2. Updated Environment Variables
**File:** `.env`
- Added `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (without NEXT_PUBLIC prefix for server-side use)
- Kept `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` for compatibility

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
**File:** `lib/services/team-matching-db.ts`
- Added detailed logging for submission attempts
- Improved error messages for different failure scenarios
- Added specific handling for RLS policy violations

### 4. Improved Questionnaire Component
**File:** `components/team-matching-questionnaire.tsx`
- Fixed UUID generation to use proper format
- Added loading state for submit button
- Enhanced error handling with specific error messages
- Added validation before submission

### 5. Created RLS Policy Fix Script
**File:** `scripts/fix-team-matching-rls.sql`
- Comprehensive SQL script to fix RLS policies
- Allows service role to bypass all restrictions
- Enables anonymous submissions for public access
- Proper policies for authenticated users

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Update Database Policies
Run the SQL script in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of scripts/fix-team-matching-rls.sql
```

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env` file has:
```
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your_service_role_key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your_anon_key"
```

### Step 3: Test the Fix
1. Go to `/team` page
2. Click "Start Team Matching"
3. Fill out the questionnaire
4. Submit and verify it works

## Technical Details

### RLS Policy Structure
The fix creates these policies:

1. **Service Role Policy**: Allows admin operations to bypass all restrictions
2. **Anonymous Insert Policy**: Allows public questionnaire submissions
3. **User-Specific Policies**: Allows users to view/edit their own data
4. **Team Member Policies**: Allows team members to view team data

### Error Handling Improvements
- **UUID Format Errors**: Fixed by using proper UUID generation
- **RLS Violations**: Clear error messages directing users to contact support
- **Duplicate Submissions**: Specific error for existing email addresses
- **Network Errors**: Separate handling for connection issues

### Security Considerations
- Service role key is properly secured (not exposed to client)
- Anonymous submissions are allowed but limited to insert-only
- Users can only access their own data
- Team data is only visible to team members

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Submit questionnaire as anonymous user
2. Submit questionnaire as authenticated user
3. Try submitting duplicate email
4. Verify error messages are user-friendly

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Test the API endpoints
node test-team-matching-api.js

# Test questionnaire submission
node test-questionnaire-submit.js
```

## Files Modified

1. `lib/supabase-admin.ts` - Fixed admin client configuration
2. `.env` - Added proper service role key
3. `lib/services/team-matching-db.ts` - Enhanced error handling
4. `components/team-matching-questionnaire.tsx` - Fixed UUID and error handling
5. `scripts/fix-team-matching-rls.sql` - Database policy fixes

## Verification Steps

After applying the fix:

1. ✅ Questionnaire submissions work for anonymous users
2. ✅ Questionnaire submissions work for authenticated users  
3. ✅ Duplicate email detection works properly
4. ✅ Error messages are user-friendly
5. ✅ Admin operations work correctly
6. ✅ Data security is maintained

## Next Steps

1. Apply the SQL script to your Supabase database
2. Restart your development server
3. Test the questionnaire submission
4. Monitor for any remaining issues
