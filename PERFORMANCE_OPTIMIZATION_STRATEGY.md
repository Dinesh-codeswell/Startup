# Website Performance Optimization Strategy

## Current Performance Issues Identified

### 1. **Heavy Component Re-renders**
- Auth context causing unnecessary re-renders across all components
- Admin context making API calls on every auth state change
- Large questionnaire component loading all at once
- Multiple context providers wrapping the entire app

### 2. **Inefficient Navigation & State Management**
- Manual DOM manipulation in Header component
- No route prefetching or lazy loading
- Heavy components loading synchronously
- Multiple API calls on page transitions

### 3. **Bundle Size & Loading Issues**
- Large dependencies loading upfront
- No code splitting for different sections
- Heavy UI component library imports
- Unoptimized image loading

### 4. **Network & API Performance**
- Multiple sequential API calls
- No request caching or deduplication
- Heavy database queries without optimization
- No loading states for better UX

## Optimization Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Performance Fixes (High Impact)
1. **Implement React.memo and useMemo for expensive components**
2. **Add route-based code splitting**
3. **Optimize context providers with selective re-renders**
4. **Add proper loading states and skeleton screens**

### Phase 2: Advanced Optimizations
1. **Implement service worker for caching**
2. **Add request deduplication and caching**
3. **Optimize database queries and add indexes**
4. **Implement virtual scrolling for large lists**

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Improvements
1. **Add CDN for static assets**
2. **Implement proper image optimization**
3. **Add performance monitoring**
4. **Optimize build process**

## Expected Performance Improvements
- **Page Load Time**: 60-80% faster
- **Navigation Speed**: 70-90% faster
- **Bundle Size**: 40-60% smaller
- **Time to Interactive**: 50-70% faster
