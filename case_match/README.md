### Sample Data

A sample CSV file (`sample_participants.csv`) is included in the project root for testing.

## Matching Algorithm Details

### Weighted Scoring System
- **Skill Compatibility**: 25%
- **Experience Balance**: 20%
- **Availability Match**: 15%
- **Work Style Match**: 15%
- **Case Type Match**: 15%
- **Education Level Match**: 10%

### Team Formation Logic

1. **Education Level Separation**
   - Undergraduate students matched separately from graduate students
   - Ensures appropriate experience and maturity levels

2. **Experience-Led Team Building**
   - Most experienced participants become team anchors
   - Balanced distribution of experience across teams

3. **Skill Balance Requirements**
   - Each team needs: Strategist, Analyst, Communicator, Coordinator
   - Algorithm prevents skill overlap while ensuring coverage

4. **Compatibility Optimization**
   - Iterative matching to maximize team compatibility scores
   - Considers multiple factors simultaneously

5. **Team Size Constraints**
   - Preferred size: 4 members
   - Minimum size: 3 members
   - Maximum size: 5 members

## Customization

### Algorithm Parameters
Edit `backend/src/matchmaking.ts` to adjust:
- Team size constraints
- Scoring weights
- Required skill categories
- Matching thresholds

### UI Customization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No valid participants found"**
   - Check CSV column headers match expected format
   - Ensure required fields (Full Name, Email ID) are populated

2. **Teams not forming optimally**
   - Verify participant data variety in skills and preferences
   - Check if minimum team size requirements are met

3. **Frontend not connecting to backend**
   - Ensure backend is running on port 4000
   - Check CORS configuration
