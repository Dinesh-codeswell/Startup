## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Testing

```bash
# Run comprehensive security tests
npm run test:security

# Validate configuration
npm run validate:config

# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Run performance benchmarks
npm run benchmark:security
```

### Step 2: Build Validation

```bash
# Clean build
npm run clean
npm run build

# Verify build artifacts
ls -la .next/

# Test production build locally
npm start
```

### Step 3: Security Header Validation

```bash
# Test security headers (replace with your domain)
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/

# Expected headers:
# X-Frame-Options: DENY
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'...
```

### Step 4: Rate Limiting Validation

```bash
# Test rate limiting (should return 429 after limit)
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo "Request $i:"
  curl -w "%{http_code}\n" -o /dev/null -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid_token" \
    https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/test
done
```

### Step 5: Admin Access Validation

```bash
# Test admin authentication with valid token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer VALID_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/dashboard

# Test unauthorized access
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer INVALID_TOKEN" \
  https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/dashboard

# Test missing authorization
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/admin/dashboard
```

### Step 6: Threat Detection Validation

```bash
# Test SQL injection detection
curl "https://yourdomain.com/admin?id=1%20UNION%20SELECT%20*%20FROM%20users"

# Test XSS detection
curl "https://yourdomain.com/admin?comment=%3Cscript%3Ealert('xss')%3C/script%3E"

# Test path traversal detection
curl "https://yourdomain.com/admin/../../../etc/passwd"
```
