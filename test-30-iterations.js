console.log('   - 4 participants prefer team size 4');
console.log('   - 6 participants prefer team size 3');
console.log('   - 3 participants prefer team size 2');
console.log('   - 2 additional participants with size 4 and 2 preferences');
console.log('   - Mixed experience levels and availability');
console.log('   - Diverse skill sets and case preferences\n');

console.log('   - Should form 1 team of size 4 (4 participants)');
console.log('   - Should form 2 teams of size 3 (6 participants)');
console.log('   - Should form 1-2 teams of size 2 (2-4 participants)');
console.log('   - Should have 0-1 unmatched participants (significant improvement!)');
console.log('   - Should use progressive strategy relaxation across 30 iterations\n');

console.log('üìã Testing Strategy:');
console.log('   - Iterations 1-3: Strict matching (education level + exact team size)');
console.log('   - Iterations 4-8: Relaxed matching (¬±1 team size difference allowed)');
console.log('   - Iterations 9-12: Strategic regrouping');
console.log('   - Iterations 13-18: Alternative grouping strategies');
console.log('   - Iterations 19-25: Flexible team size matching');
console.log('   - Iterations 26-30: Emergency matching with minimal constraints\n');

console.log('üîß To test the enhanced system:');
console.log('1. Start the development server: npm run dev');
console.log('2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/case-match');
console.log('3. Upload the temp-30-iteration-test.csv file');
console.log('4. Check the browser console for detailed iteration logs');
console.log('5. Verify that most/all participants are matched\n');

console.log('‚úì 30 iterations maximum (increased from 10)');
console.log('‚úì Progressive constraint relaxation');
console.log('‚úì Better handling of unmatched students');
console.log('‚úì Flexible team size matching in later iterations');
console.log('‚úì Emergency matching as last resort');
console.log('‚úì Detailed logging of each iteration strategy\n');

console.log('üéØ Success Criteria:');
console.log('   - Matching efficiency should be >90% (vs previous ~30%)');
console.log('   - Maximum 1-2 unmatched participants');
console.log('   - Teams should still maintain reasonable compatibility');
console.log('   - Progressive relaxation should be visible in logs\n');
