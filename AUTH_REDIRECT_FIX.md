# Authentication Redirect Fix

## Problem
Users signing in with OAuth (Google, etc.) were being redirected to Supabase's hosted authentication page instead of staying on your website.

## Root Cause
The OAuth redirect URLs were not properly configured to handle the authentication callback and redirect users back to your website.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated OAuth Configuration in Login/Signup Pages
- **Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)**: Fixed OAuth redirect URL to include proper callback handling
- **Signup Page (`app/signup/page.tsx`)**: Added redirect_to parameter for OAuth flows

### 2. Enhanced Auth Callback Route (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- Added comprehensive error handling for OAuth errors
- Improved logging for debugging authentication issues
- Added validation for redirect URLs to prevent open redirects
- Enhanced profile creation/update logic for OAuth users
- Added success indicators in the redirect URL

### 3. Created Missing UI Components
- `components/ui/input.tsx` - Input component for forms
- `components/ui/separator.tsx` - Separator component for UI
- `components/ui/progress.tsx` - Progress bar component

### 4. Created Auth Test Page (`app/auth-test/page.tsx`)
- Test page to verify OAuth redirects work properly
- Shows authentication status and user information
- Allows testing the complete OAuth flow

## How It Works Now

1. **User clicks "Continue with Google"** on login/signup page
2. **OAuth request** includes proper `redirectTo` parameter pointing to `/auth/callback`
3. **Google authenticates** user and redirects to your callback URL
4. **Callback route** exchanges code for session and creates/updates user profile
5. **User is redirected** back to your website (homepage or intended destination)

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Testing
1. Go to `/login` or `/signup`
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Complete Google authentication
4. Verify you're redirected back to your website (not Supabase)

### Automated Testing
Visit `/auth-test` to test the OAuth flow with detailed feedback.

## Configuration Requirements

### Supabase Dashboard Settings
Make sure your Supabase project has the correct redirect URLs configured:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
2. Add these redirect URLs:
   - `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (for development)
   - `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback` (for production)

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Files Modified

1. `app/login/page.tsx` - Fixed OAuth redirect configuration
2. `app/signup/page.tsx` - Fixed OAuth redirect configuration  
3. `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Enhanced callback handling
4. `components/ui/input.tsx` - Created missing UI component
5. `components/ui/separator.tsx` - Created missing UI component
6. `components/ui/progress.tsx` - Created missing UI component
7. `app/auth-test/page.tsx` - Created test page

## Key Improvements

- ✅ Users stay on your website during authentication
- ✅ Proper error handling for OAuth failures
- ✅ Automatic profile creation for OAuth users
- ✅ Secure redirect URL validation
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging
- ✅ Success indicators for better UX

## Next Steps

1. Test the authentication flow thoroughly
2. Update Supabase redirect URLs for production
3. Monitor authentication logs for any issues
4. Consider adding more OAuth providers if needed
